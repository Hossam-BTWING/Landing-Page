## Description

this my landing project, I tried my best to complete it as required.
If there is something wrong with it, I will be happy to know your feedback.

## Techniques used

* HTML: I just created a 4th section.
* CSS : I added some styling to the navigation buttons while active, also tried to make the scrolling smooth as possiple.
* Javascript: 
* Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.
* It is clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page. 
* When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section. 
* A function was added so that the nav bar will not navigate us anywhere until a link is clicked not anywhere inside the tab.
